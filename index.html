    <P>AkiraChix is a program that equips girls from the needy background in order for them to make their marks in tech.
        It's been a week since I came to Akirachix and its been a really intense but good experience.
        By the end of the year,I want to have acquired all the skills I will need to stand out in the tech field.</P>

    <h2>My Experience in AkiraChix</h2>
    <p>Nothing is perfect, my experience in AkiraChix has been good and not so good at the same time.
        Below are some of the experiences I've had.</p>

    <h3>My Good Experiences</h3>

        <li>The receivement on the admission day</li>
        <li>Coding for the first time</li>
        <li>The sessions we've had with Linda</li>
        <li>Engaging and living with others from diverse communities</li>
    </ol>


    <h3>My Not So Good Experiences</h3>

        <li>Limited to sleep or rest</li>
